## Things to do

* Create a good README.md file with a good explanation and an image, to get the idea
* Add a multiplayer version of the game, for now I'll relax
* Optimize and resolve some minor issues such as nations name translations

If you want to test the project, clone the repo, install the python dependecies (I suggest using a virtual environment, like pipenv but do as you like)
and play it for yourself, if you encounter any error, problem or things like that, let me know.
If everything works just fine, then enjoy the local match mode, play with a friend or someone close to you (local mode means you're using the same computer to play).
