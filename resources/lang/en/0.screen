*Game rules*
Welcome to *TERMIKO!* a strategic, turn-based, terminal game heavily inspired
by the board game *RISIKO!*.
It's not easy to make a terminal game and also have easy and intuitive controls to play it,
but fortunately a quick read through the rules will make your life easier.
The only keys to use in the game are the *DIRECTIONAL ARROWS*, *ENTER* and *DELETE* keys.
To move through the rules press *ENTER* or *RIGHT* to move forward and *LEFT* to go backwards.
You can press *DELETE* at any time to get back to the main menu.
Let's get started, shall we?
